		<h1>A bank of ideas for me to code when I get some spare time.</h1>
		<h2>Someday.....</h2>
		<p>This will eventually be a place for me to keep a list of projects that I would like to work on when I have time to play around and experiment.</p>
		<ul>It will simply be an unordered list like this....
			<li>Make a set of icons.
			<p>Take the project one step further and create an icon set of your own. It could be anything from a weather icon set to social network icons. Once you're done, post them on the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/forum">forum</a> for other members to critique or download.</p>
			</li>
